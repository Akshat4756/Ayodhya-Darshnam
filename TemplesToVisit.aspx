                            <p class="text-cs">Situated on the banks of River Saryu, Guptar Ghat holds immense religious significance. According to legend, this was the place where Lord Rama had taken his last dip (jal samadhi) to leave the earth and go back to his original abode 'Vaikunta'. It is a popular belief among devotees that taking a dip in the Saryu river on this ghat will wash away their sins and relieve them from worldly worries. The ghat resounds with the chants of Lord Rama's name as devotees and priests sing hymns in his praises. Tourists can also visit Raja Mandir and Chakra Harji Vishnu Temple located near Guptar Ghat, which is lined with temples of Ram Janki, Charan Paduka, Narasingh and Lord Hanuman. The well-maintained ghats were built by Raja Darshan Singh during the first half of the 19th century.</p>
